Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello! My name is Kevin Muli. I am currently learning Git and GitHub as part of my course.  
I am excited to build my first repository and practice version control workflows.

I am enthusiastic about learning new technologies and improving my collaboration skills.  
This project will help me understand Git commands, branching, and making pull requests effectively.
