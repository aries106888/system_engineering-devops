Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello! My name is Kevin Muli Wambua. I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Software Engineering, and I have a strong interest in website development, Bash scripting, and version control using Git and GitHub.

I created this repository to practice creating files, making commits, and learning the workflow of GitHub repositories.
